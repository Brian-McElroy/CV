## A little bit about me.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a higher diploma in computer science and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and  'Kitman Labs'.
Currently I am making my own games entirely by myself (design, code, art, audio).
