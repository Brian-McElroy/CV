This video shows me running through a session with 'Capture'.
Captures purpose is to prompt and guide the athletes through a very speficic series of musculo-skeletal movements and record their 3D body geometry as they do so, for further analysis.
I was the lead programmer on this project.

## How I got here.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a higher diploma in computing and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and  'Kitman Labs'.
Currently I am making my own games entirely by myself (design, code, art, audio), and also doing the odd bit of contract work. 

## My skills

During my game dev career many of the projects I worked on involved novel problems, for which I successfully implemented groundbreaking solutions. Based on my past experiences and performance, I feel happy to take on any challenge in the realm of software / game design.

My core skills are..

* Game programming
* Software architecture
* Project Management
* Game Design

I also have some competence in the following..
