## Examples of my work.

   Kitman Labs Capture prompts and guides athletes through a very specific series of musculo-skeletal movements and records their 3D body geometry as they do so. This data is then used in  statistical analysis for the purpose of injury prevention.
   I was the lead programmer for the Capture client.

	Liquid Physics 2D was a plugin asset for Unity I wrote which allowed developers to easily implement highly optimised 2D particle phsyics in their games.

## Background.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a higher diploma in computing and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and 'Kitman Labs'.
Currently I am making my own games entirely by myself (design, code, art, audio), and also doing the odd bit of contract work. 

## Skills

In my game dev career many of the projects I worked on involved novel problems, for which I successfully implemented groundbreaking solutions. Based on my past experiences and performance, I feel happy to take on any challenge.

When it comes to writing any kind of software my approach is to attain the maximum maintainability through clear and well-ordered architecture.

I have experience working in an enviromnent using the latest good software writing practices. Git, Scrum, Peer review, testing.  

My core skills are..

* Game design
* Game programming
* Software architecture
* Project Management
* Unity expert

I also have some competence in the following..

* Creating 2D art for games in Illustrator / Photoshop.
* Creating sound effects and music for games.
* Creating 3D meshes for games.
