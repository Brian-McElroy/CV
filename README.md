## Some examples of my work.

* [Capture](https://youtu.be/30xvRLjY0jU)

   [Kitman Labs](https://www.kitmanlabs.com/) Capture prompts and guides athletes through a very specific series of musculo-skeletal movements and records their 3D body geometry as they do so. This data is then used in  statistical analysis for the purpose of injury prevention.
   I was the lead programmer for the Capture client.

	Liquid Physics 2D was a plugin asset for Unity I wrote which allowed developers to easily implement highly optimised 2D particle phsyics in their games.

	An online multiplayer WebGL / PC / Android game I am currently making with a small team.
	
* [Wave Master](https://youtu.be/F8nCd9Dje20)

	A simple educational game which teaches about the properties of waves I made on contract for [Legends of Learning.](https://www.legendsoflearning.com/)
	
* [Cube Collector](https://youtu.be/RwbznCCA-Do)

	Another educational game for 'Legends of Learning'. This teaches about volume and unit cubes.
		
* [TapTapTapTapTap](https://youtu.be/D9OVPMaNwfY)

	A simple mobile arcade game I made which is at the pre-release stage.
	
* make a square

	An incredibly elegant puzzle game. I'm quite proud that I discovered an original game that seems so *fundamental*.
	This theme of minimalism is carried through by the beautiful and serene graphics, UI, and audio.

## Background.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a level 8 higher diploma in computing and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and 'Kitman Labs'.
Currently, I am making my own indie games with the artist [Pablo Bredow](http://www.pablobredow.com/) as 'Sangen.Games' 

## Skills.

In my game dev career many of the projects I worked on involved novel problems, for which I successfully implemented groundbreaking solutions. Based on my past experiences and performance, I feel happy to take on any challenge.

When writing software, my default approach is to optimise for code-maintainability above everything else. I achieve this by always writing code in small, independant, re-usable, and testable modules.
With this approach, my productivty remains constant and predictable over the lifetime of the project, as features are removed, added, or changed.

Good communication is key to a successful software project. On a team, I am a clear and frequent communicator. It is much better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.
As an architect, I was trained to present my ideas, and *sell* them to the team.

I have experience working in an enviromnent using the latest good software writing practices. Git, Scrum, Peer-review, Testing, Documentation.  

My core skills are...

* Game design.
* Game programming.
* Unity expert.

I also have some competence in the following...

* Project management.
* Creating 2D art for games in Illustrator / Photoshop.
* Creating sound effects and music for games.
* Creating 3D meshes for games.
