## Some examples of my work.

* KnowCLT

	[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.POTIONSPIXELS.KnowCLT&gl=US)  .  [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/knowclt/id1574549739)<br/>	
	[Programme made by PBS featuring the app (skip to 18:18)](https://video.wtvi.org/video/34-urban-renewal-qsgutd/)<br/>
	I made this app as a contractor with a small team I assembled. The client was the [Levine museum of the city of Charlotte, North Carolina.](https://www.museumofthenewsouth.org/)
	The app uses AR to accurately fit historical images over modern day reality, and guides users to the sites via a GPS map. The app has its own content management system that the museum staff can use to update the content within it. The app also has some social features, for example users can like, share, and comment on the content. We also gamified the app, there are achievements, and users can win discounts and freebies in real world businesses in the area.

* Trash Dash CLT

	[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PotionsAndPixels.TrashTruckers)  .  [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trash-dash-clt/id1561390973)<br/>	
	I made this game as a contractor with a small team I assembled. The client was the trash department of the city of Charlotte, North Carolina.
	The purpose of the game was to educate the public about what the trash department does and what struggles they face. As well as having to design a fun game, I also had to ensure that the game was on-message, these extra constraints made the design process challenging but the result was a success.
	The game is very approachable and easy to pick up for any player, and yet by playing it, the player directly experiences the same issues that the trash department does. This 'bridges the empathy gap' between the player and the client.
   
* make a square 

	[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SandwichGeneration.MakeASquare&hl=en_US&gl=US)  .  [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/make-a-square/id1495772847)<br/>	
	An incredibly elegant puzzle game. I'm quite proud that I discovered an original game that seems so *fundamental*.
	This theme of minimalism is carried through by the beautiful and serene graphics, UI, and audio.
	
* Capture

	[Video](https://youtu.be/30xvRLjY0jU)<br/>
	Kitman Capture prompts and guides athletes through a very specific series of musculo-skeletal movements and records their 3D body geometry as they do so. This data is then used in  statistical analysis for the purpose of injury prevention.
	I was the lead programmer for the Capture client while working at [Kitman Labs](https://www.kitmanlabs.com/).
   
* Liquid Physics 2D
	
	[Video](https://youtu.be/9qU3aVAADZY)<br/>	
	Liquid Physics 2D was a plugin asset sold on the Unity asset store which allowed developers to easily implement highly optimised 2D particle phsyics in their games. I made this while working for the company 'Physical Liquid'.
	
* LazerGrrl

	[Video](https://youtu.be/Zr0A8VcBnYk)<br/>	
	An online multiplayer WebGL / PC / Android game I made and released for free. It got a good reception and I am currently working on a massively updated version to be released on Steam.
	
* Wave Master

	[Video](https://youtu.be/F8nCd9Dje20)<br/>
	A simple educational game which teaches about the properties of waves I made on contract for [Legends of Learning.](https://www.legendsoflearning.com/)
	This game had to be hyper-optimised, it basically had to run on a potato.
	Desiging educational games for Legends of Learning was a challenge as, as well as having to design a fun game, there were many specific design constraints in what form the game took and exactly which learning objectives it taught.
	
* Cube Collector

	[Video](https://youtu.be/RwbznCCA-Do)<br/>
	Another educational game for 'Legends of Learning'. This teaches about volume and unit cubes.
	
## Background.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a level 8 higher diploma in computing and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and 'Kitman Labs'.
Currently, I do contracts and make my own games for fun.

## Skills.

In my game-dev career, many of the projects I worked on involved novel problems, for which I successfully implemented groundbreaking solutions. Based on my past experiences and performance, I feel happy to take on any challenge.

When writing software, my default approach is to optimise for code-maintainability above everything else. I achieve this by always writing code in small, independant, re-usable, and testable modules.
With this approach, my productivty remains constant and predictable over the lifetime of the project, as features are removed, added, or changed.

Good communication is key to a successful software project. On a team, I am a clear and frequent communicator. It is much better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.
As an architect, I was trained to present my ideas, and *sell* them to the team.

Another skill I developed while working as an architect was project management. I can manage myself or a team to ensure that a software project gets completed on time and on budget, with a resulting product that is fit for purpose.

I have experience working in an enviromnent using the latest good software writing practices. Git, Scrum, Peer-review, Testing, Documentation.  

My core skills are...

* Game design.
* Game programming.
* Unity expert.
* Project management.

I also have some competence in the following...

* Creating 2D art for games in Illustrator / Photoshop.
* Creating sound effects and music for games.
* Creating 3D meshes for games.
