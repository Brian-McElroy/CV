## Some examples of my work.

* [Capture](https://youtu.be/30xvRLjY0jU)

   [Kitman Labs](https://www.kitmanlabs.com/) Capture prompts and guides athletes through a very specific series of musculo-skeletal movements and records their 3D body geometry as they do so. This data is then used in  statistical analysis for the purpose of injury prevention.
   I was the lead programmer for the Capture client.

	Liquid Physics 2D was a plugin asset for Unity I wrote which allowed developers to easily implement highly optimised 2D particle phsyics in their games.

	A simple educational game which teaches about the properties of waves I made for [Legends of Learning.](https://www.legendsoflearning.com/)

## Background.

I have a degree in architecture, and have worked as an architect.
In 2013 I got a level 8 higher diploma in computing and began my career in game programming.
I worked as a lead dev for 'Physical Liquid' and 'Kitman Labs'.
Currently I am making my own games entirely by myself (design, code, art, audio), and also doing the odd bit of contract work. 

## Skills

In my game dev career many of the projects I worked on involved novel problems, for which I successfully implemented groundbreaking solutions. Based on my past experiences and performance, I feel happy to take on any challenge.

When it comes to writing any kind of software, my approach is to attain the maximum maintainability, through modularity, clear software architecture, and simply *always* following the fundamentals : tiny methods, tiny classes, avoid duplication, avoid coupling.
With this approach my productivty remains constant and predictable as new features are added.

Good communication is key to a successful software project. On a team, I am a clear and frequent communicator. It is much better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.
As an architect, I was trained to present my ideas, and *sell* them to the team.

I have experience working in an enviromnent using the latest good software writing practices. Git, Scrum, Peer-review, Testing, Documentation.  

My core skills are..

* Game design
* Game programming
* Software architecture
* Project Management
* Unity expert

I also have some competence in the following..

* Creating 2D art for games in Illustrator / Photoshop.
* Creating sound effects and music for games.
* Creating 3D meshes for games.
